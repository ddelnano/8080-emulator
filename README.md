This is my implementation of emulator101.com

## Testing

```bash
$ make test
```

This will use a 8080 binary that will try to test many opcodes.  It's not a perfect test but can catch bugs in many of the opcodes.

## Running

For now this only runs on OS X, in the future maybe this will work on the web with web assembly or on Linux.  Use xcode to build the project.
